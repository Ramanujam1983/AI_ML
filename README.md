Whether you are a beginner exploring ML basics or a professional building production-grade AI systems, this repo aims to provide clean, understandable, and impactful examples.

🗂️ Repository Structure
🧠 Basics/

This folder contains foundational tutorials and practical examples covering core AI/ML algorithms:

Regression

Classification

Clustering

Dimensionality Reduction

Feature Engineering

Model Evaluation

Every example is written with clarity so you can easily understand what the algorithm is doing and why.

🚀 Projects/

This folder contains real-world, end-to-end, impactful AI/ML and GenAI projects, including:

Production-ready pipelines

API-based ML deployments

Integrations with cloud storage, databases, and message queues

Real datasets and realistic challenges

Scalable architectures

These projects go beyond simple demos—they are designed to reflect industry-grade implementations.

☁️ AI/ML + Cloud (Azure | AWS | GCP)

Modern AI systems are cloud-native.
This repository also explores:

Cloud-based ML pipelines

Big Data processing with Spark, Databricks, and cloud services

Containerized and serverless ML deployments

End-to-end MLOps workflows

Monitoring, logging, and CI/CD for AI

Model versioning, registry, and automated retraining

The goal is to help you not only build ML models—but deploy, scale, and operate them in real production systems.

📌 Roadmap

 Add more ML fundamentals

 Expand GenAI examples (LLMs, embeddings, RAG, fine-tuning)

 Add cloud pipeline templates (Azure/AWS/GCP)

 Include Big Data ETL and streaming examples

 Create end-to-end MLOps templates
